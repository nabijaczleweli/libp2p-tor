//! Tor based transport for libp2p. Connect through the Tor network to TCP listeners.
//!
//! # ⚠️ Misuse warning ⚠️ - read carefully before using
//! Although the sound of "Tor" might convey a sense of security it is *very* easy to misuse this
//! crate and leaking private information while using. Study libp2p carefully and try to make sure
//! you fully understand it's current limits regarding privacy. I.e. using identify might already
//! render this transport obsolete.
//!
//! This transport explicitly **doesn't** provide any enhanced privacy if it's just used like a regular transport.
//! Use with caution and at your own risk. **Don't** just blindly advertise Tor without fully understanding what you
//! are dealing with.
//!
//! ## Runtime
//!
//! This crate uses tokio with rustls for its runtime and TLS implementation.
//! No other combinations are supported.
//!
//! ## Example
//! ```no_run
//! use libp2p::core::Transport;
//! # async fn test_func() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let address = "/dns/www.torproject.org/tcp/1000".parse()?;
//! let mut transport = libp2p_community_tor::TorTransport::bootstrapped().await?;
//! // we have achieved tor connection
//! let _conn = transport.dial(address)?.await?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! # tokio_test::block_on(test_func());
//! ```
